    <h2 id="1">1 What is MIDA?</h2>
    <p>MIDA is a minimalistic language for creating generative MIDI
      files. MIDA is not interactive in sense that you cannot control
      result of its activity in real time, it is indended for
      producers and should be used with a DAW. MIDA can help you
      create variative elements in your music in a very simple
      way. Since MIDI can control a lot of different instruments,
      power of MIDA is truly great.</p>

    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h2 id="2">2 Installation</h2>
    <p>It's absolutely possible to install MIDA on any platform on
      which <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell
      Platform</a> is supported. However, there are some precompiled
      options that may be more convenient and straightforward for some
      people. In particular, I propose installer for Windows users and
      self-extracting script for Linux users. To install MIDA on other
      platforms see section <a href="2.3">2.3 Compilation from
      Source</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="2.1">2.1 Windows</h3>
    <p>To install MIDA on
      windows <a href="https://github.com/mrkkrp/mida/releases">download
      MIDA installer</a>, then run it. To uninstall MIDA, run
      uninstaller.</p>
    <h3 id="2.2">2.2 Linux</h3>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/mrkkrp/mida/releases">Download
      self-extracting script</a> and run it as root. To uninstall MIDA
      execute:</p>
    <pre># midarm</pre>
    <p>The script will remove MIDA from your system.</p>
    <h3 id="2.3">2.3 Compilation from Source</h3>
    <p>First,
      install <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell
      Platform</a>. You also need to
      install <a href="http://www.haskell.org/cabal/">Cabal</a>. After
      that, download or
      clone <a href="https://github.com/mrkkrp/mida">MIDA
      repository</a>.</p>
    <p>Usually you need to update list of available
      packages before compilation, so do this:</p>
    <pre>$ cabal update
$ cabal install cabal-install</pre>
    <p>Now <code>cd</code> into directory containing downloaded
      repository of MIDA and execute:</p>
    <pre>$ cabal configure
$ cabal build</pre>
    <p>It's very likely that Cabal will not compile MIDA from the
      first time so you'll need to install all dependencies that Cabal
      will list for you.</p>
    <p>After compilation you should manually copy executable
      file <code>dist/bulid/mida/mida</code> into some directory where
      your system will see the executable. Linux users can run the
      following script (it also copies documentation
      and <code>midarm</code> for uninstallation.):</p>
    <pre># sh install.sh</pre>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h2 id="3">3 Invocation</h2>
    <p>MIDA can work as a translator from source code to MIDI files,
      and also as an interactive environment (interpreter). Here's
      invocation scheme:</p>
    <pre>mida [-i|--interactive] [-s|--seed SEED] [-q|--quarter TICKS]
     [-b|--beats BEATS] [-o|--output OUT] [FILE]</pre>
    <p>Let's list all available options:</p>
   <table>
      <tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      <tr><td><code>-h</code>,<code>--help</code></td>
        <td>Shows this information about invocation parameters and available options</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>-i</code>,<code>--interactive</code></td>
        <td>Enables interactive (interpreter) mode</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>-s</code>,<code>--seed</code></td>
        <td>Sets seed for MIDI generation, default value is <code>0</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>-q</code>,<code>--quarter</code></td>
        <td>Sets number of ticks for quarter note, default value is <code>24</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>-b</code>,<code>--beats</code></td>
        <td>Sets total time of result MIDI file as number of quarter notes (beats), default value is <code>16</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>-o</code>,<code>--output</code></td>
        <td>Specifies output filename; default value is evaluated as <code>FILE</code> with extension <code>.mid</code></td></tr>
   </table>
    <p>If you don't supply any file as a command line argument, MIDA
      will run in interactive mode even without <code>-i</code>
      option. Note that options <code>-s</code>, <code>-q</code>,
      and <code>-b</code> will be ignored if option <code>-i</code> is
      used.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h2 id="4">4 Configuration File</h2>
    <p>One can customize MIDA to some extent using the configuration
      file. One should create the file in his home directory. This
      directory will be different on different operating systems. On
      Linux machines it would be something
      like <code>/home/username/.mida</code>, while Windows users
      should create the file
      in <code>C:\Users\username\.mida</code>.</p>
    <p>For now, only two parameters can be changed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&bull; prompt (as <code>prompt</code>);</li>
        <li>&bull; length of displayed result of evaluation
        (as <code>length</code>).</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Syntax of <code>.mida</code> file is one of Unix configuration
      file. That is, you can use <code>#</code> for line comments,
      and <code>=</code> to assign new values (spaces before and
      after <code>=</code> are allowed).</p>
    <p>Here is complete example of <code>.mida</code> file:</p>
    <pre>#
# MIDA Configuration File
#

prompt = &quot;M> &quot;
length = 20
</pre>

    <h2 id="5">5 MIDA Tutorial</h2>
    <p>Now that you know all basic information about the interpreter,
      we can start our journey into the magic world of MIDA.</p>
    <p>MIDA is minimalistic and not very flexible or complex. In fact,
      it is so simple that any statement that has valid synax will
      produce a valid result. A MIDA statement only has to pass
      parser, that's all. In fact, it's quite hard to enter invalid
      statement in MIDA and we'll see why.</p>
    <p>If you're interested in generative music, you probably know
      that there are lots of really advanced programs for algorithmic
      composition. But take a look at the output of those programs. I
      don't mean to offend someone, but it's often not that
      impressive.</p>
    <p>What is the reason of that? Well, people who work with
      complicated tools tend to pay more attention to process than
      result. The more compilated tool you use the more time you spend
      on tool itself. Algorithm may be really impressive, but audience
      just don't give a fuck. We're gonna use basic tools of MIDA to
      create super sexy pop stuff, that's what we need, man.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.1">5.1 Literal Values</h3>
    <p>Start interactive environment. Now you should be looking at
      something like this:</p>
    <pre>[mark@arch ~]$ mida
-> Loading MIDA Interactive Environment v0.1.0;
mida> _</pre>
    <p>You can try your powers right away. Remeber, MIDA is all about
      sequences of numbers. Numbers can repesent different things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&bull; durations;</li>
      <li>&bull; velocities;</li>
      <li>&bull; pitches.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's start from how you can enter the numbers at the prompt
      and what you get as a result.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.1.1">5.1.1 Durations</h3>
    <p>Durations in MIDI are relative to <i>ticks per quarter note</i>
      (TPQ). TPQ is set before translation either via command line
      options or as a parameter of <code>:make</code> command. As I
      said, default value is <code>24</code>, so try to work with this
      in mind.</p>
    <p>So, if quarter note is <code>24</code> ticks, whole note will
      be <code>96</code> ticks, while eight note will
      be <code>12</code> ticks, etc. You can also use any number in
      between, creating really strange rhythms. Don't
      use <code>0</code>, because it's pretty useless and if your
      'score' consists of only zero durations you'll be unable to get
      realization longer than zero bars. Remember that you can use
      numbers greater than <code>127</code> for duration, so there is
      no limits.</p>
    <p>Let's enter a number:</p>
    <pre>mida> 24
=> 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24...
mida> _</pre>
    <p>So, we see that we can enter literal values! However, the
    result may look a bit strange, but ignore this repetitiveness for
    now.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.1.2">5.1.2 Velocities</h3>
    <p>Since MIDI format is piano-oriented, velocity in our case means
      loudness. Again, to write down velocities we use plain
      numbers. Valid values are form <code>0</code>
      to <code>127</code>, where <code>0</code> means silence,
      while <code>127</code> signifies loudest note.</p>
    <p>Although you can enter literals greater than <code>127</code>,
      they are not guaranteed to be processed correctly.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.1.3">5.1.3 Pitches</h3>
    <p>Sure, you can use the same plain numbers from <code>0</code>
      to <code>127</code> for pitch, but it's a bit inconvinient. MIDA
      knows some alias for that case. Since MIDA doesn't work with
      negative numbers, we use alias where octaves start
      from <code>0</code>. So <code>c0</code> corresponds
      to <code>0</code>, <code>c#1</code> to <code>1</code>, and so
      on: one semitone per number.</p>
    <p> This table may be useful:</p>
    <table>
      <tr><th rowspan="2">Octaves</th><th colspan="12">Notes</th></tr>

    </table>
    <p>Please note that there is no standard way to number octaves in
      MIDI. The MIDI standard only says that note with
      index <code>60</code> must be <i>Middle C</i>. We've chosen
      zero-based system for reasons that I've described earlier, some
      software starts numeration from <code>-2</code>.</p>
    <p>Enter any alais into MIDA and see for yourself that it's just
      like entering corresponding MIDI code (note that all alais are
      case-sensitive):</p>
    <pre>mida> c5
=> 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60...</pre>
    <p>...and that's it! Now you can use literal values. Oh, that's
      incredible.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.2">5.2 Elements, Principles, and Realizations</h3>
    <p>Smallest piece of composition in MIDA is
      called <i>element</i>. Now we know at least one kind of element:
      literal values. Realization of a literal value is just its
      value. Bear with me and all the stuff will be clear to you.</p>
    <p>Thing we enter into interactive prompt is
      called <i>principle</i>. A principle can consist of zero or more
      elements. These elements may be separated by
      commas <code>,</code>. Let's try some principles:</p>
    <pre>mida> 1, 2, 3
=> 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1...
mida> c5 d5 e5 f5 g5 a5 b5 c6
=> 60 62 64 65 67 69 71 72 60 62 64 65 67 69 71 72...</pre>
    <p>So, we enter a principle and MIDA prints its
      realization. Realization of a principle is bulit this way:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&bull; MIDA cycles elements (not their values, you'll see
      difference later), so we have now infinite collection of
      elements;</li>
      <li>&bull; it realizes all the elements one by one.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that MIDA realizes just as much as you need due
      to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation">lazy
      evaluation</a>.</p>
    <p>Realization can be either infinite sequence of non-negative
      numbers or <code>none</code>. <code>none</code> is a special
      value that represent realization of empty principle:</p>
    <pre>mida> 
=> none</pre>
    <p>In the next section we will see other roles
      of <code>none</code>.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.3">5.3 Definitions</h3>
    <p>I said that it's quite hard to write an incorrect statement in
      MIDA. Let's prove it. This is my attempt:</p>
    <pre>mida> foo
=> none
mida> asdfasdflk
=> none
mida> 1 2 rere 5
=> 1 2 5 1 2 5 1 2 5 1 2 5 1 2 5 1...</pre>
    <p>So, MIDA thinks that these things are realized
      to <code>none</code>, they can be even put inside a principle
      without any obvious harm.</p>
    <p>The thing is that MIDA considers any alpha-numeric sequence of
      characters that does not begin with a
      number <i>definition</i>. Definition can hold a principle and
      default value of any definition is <code>none</code>. You can
      combine definitions to build really complex principles. Keep in
      mind that names of the definitions are case-sensitive.</p>
    <p>One can create definitions by putting definition name on the
      left side of equation sign <code>=</code> and a principle on the
      right of the sigh. Let's give it a go:</p>
    <pre>mida> foo = 1 2 3
-> defined 'foo'
mida> foo
=> 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1...
mida> foo 5
=> 1 2 3 5 1 2 3 5 1 2 3 5 1 2 3 5...</pre>
    <p>It seems to work! What a magic! Remember that definitions are
      something like recipies how to create a principle, not static
      values. So we can change a definition and all other definitions
      which use it will change accordingly:</p>
    <pre>mida> foo = 5 boo = 6 baz = foo boo
-> defined 'foo'
-> defined 'boo'
-> defined 'baz'
mida> baz
=> 5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6...
mida> boo = 10
-> defined 'boo'
mida> baz
=> 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10...</pre>
    <p>And since all possible definitions are bound
      to <code>none</code>, we can even design our principles in
      top-down manner, using definitions that we haven't defined
      yet!</p>
    <p>Now you're ready to create your first piece of music, but
      before you do it I should explain something about <i>top-level
      definitions</i>. There are special names that represent
      duration, velocity, and pitch of voices. There may be up to 8
      different voices in a MIDA score.</p>
    <p>The names are as following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&bull; <code>dur_</code> &ndash; durations;</li>
      <li>&bull; <code>vel_</code> &ndash; velocities;</li>
      <li>&bull; <code>pch_</code> &ndash; pitches.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Substitute <code>_</code> with index of desired voice, valid
      values are from <code>0</code> to <code>7</code>.</p>
    <p>Let's create some music:</p>
    <pre>mida> dur0 = 24
-> defined 'dur0'
mida> vel0 = 70
-> defined 'vel0'
mida> pch0 = c5 d5 e5 f5 g5 a5 b5
-> defined 'pch0'</pre>
    <p>It's as simple as that! Other top-level definitions hold empty
      principles, so they will be ignored. Use <code>:make</code>
      command to create a MIDI file:</p>
    <pre>mida> :make 0 24 14
-> MIDI file saved as &quot;interactive.mid&quot;.</pre>
    <p>Use any available software to hear this astonishing
      masterpiece. Description of available special commands is given
      in the next section.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.4">5.4 Special Commands</h3>
    <p>MIDA has a number of useful commands that can be invoked from
      interactive environment. All the commands begin with
      colon <code>:</code> and are case-sensitive. Let's examine all
      of them.</p>
    <h6>:help</h6>
    <p>Let's start with <code>:help</code>, this command prints list
      of all available commands and their descriptions:</p>
    <pre>mida> :help
Available commands:
  :help                    Show this help text
  :save                    Save current enviroment in specified file
  :purge                   Remove redundant definitions
  :make                    Generate MIDI file in current environment
  :def                     Print definition of given symbol
  :prompt                  Set MIDA prompt
  :length                  Set length of displayed results
  :quit                    Quit the interactive environment</pre>
    <h6>:prompt</h6>
    <p>You can temporarily change MIDA prompt
      with <code>:prompt</code> command:</p>
    <pre>mida> :prompt boom>
boom> _</pre>
    <h6>:length</h6>
    <p>You can also set how many elements of realized principle will
      be displayed:</p>
    <pre>mida> 1
=> 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1...
mida> :length 20
mida> 1
=> 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1...</pre>
    <h6>:def</h6>
    <p>It's possible to see any definition by its name
      with <code>:def</code> command:</p>
    <pre>mida> foo = 12
-> defined 'foo'
mida> :def foo
=> foo = 12
mida> :def bar
=> cannot find the definition</pre>
    <h6>:purge</h6>
    <p>You can 'purge' all useless definitions from memory
      using <code>:purge</code> command. A definition is considered
      useless if it's not used as a part of a top-level
      definition. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre>mida> foo = bar bar = 12 baz = 13 dur0 = foo
-> defined 'foo'
-> defined 'bar'
-> defined 'baz'
-> defined 'dur0'
mida> :def baz
=> baz = 13 
mida> :purge
-> environment purged;
mida> :def baz
=> cannot find the definition</pre>
    <p>What happened here? Well, we see that <code>dur0</code> is a
      top level definition. <code>foo</code> is used
      in <code>dur0</code>'s principle and <code>bar</code> is used
      in <code>foo</code>'s principle. So, <code>foo</code>
      and <code>bar</code> are necessary definitions. What's
      about <code>baz</code>? It does not participate in principle
      building for any top-level definition. System considers it
      useless, so it purges it.</p>
    <h6>:save</h6>
    <p>As you compose music with MIDA, you will need to save all
      existing definitions to hard disk. You can then edit them as a
      normal file or load it into MIDA to continue your work. It's
      quite easy to accomplish with <code>:save</code> command. This
      command takes an optional argument - filename. If you don't
      supply the filename, system will try to guess it. It will be
      filename of loaded source file, last used filename, or default
      value <code>interactive</code>. I recommend <code>.da</code> as
      filename extension for MIDA source files.</p>
    <pre>mida> :save
-> environment saved as &quot;interactive&quot;.
mida> :save boo.da
-> environment saved as &quot;boo.da&quot;.
mida> :save
-> environment saved as &quot;boo.da&quot;.</pre>
    <h6>:make</h6>
    <p>One of most useful commands is <code>:make</code>. It creates
      MIDI file based on current state of MIDA environment. This
      command takes up to four arguments. If you don't supply any of
      them, corresponding default value will be used.</p>
    <p>First argument is <i>seed</i> for random generator. We work
      with seeds because they allow to generate identical scores for
      identical seeds (it's useful sometimes). Default value of this
      argument is <code>0</code>.</p>
    <p>Second argument is number of <i>ticks per quarter
      note</i>. This value allows to convert abstract numbers in score
      into conventional notes. Default value is <code>24</code>, and
      usually you don't want to change it unless you're working with
      extremely complex rhythms.</p>
    <p>Third argument is total length of composition as number of
      quarter notes. This parameter is also known as 'beats'. Default
      value is <code>16</code>.</p>
    <p>The last parameter is filename of MIDI file. If it's not
      supplied system will try to guess the name. Guessing algorithm
      is the same as for <code>:save</code> command but extension will
      be replaced with <code>.mid</code>.</p>
    <p>See the stuff in action:</p>
    <pre>mida> :make 0 24 16
-> MIDI file saved as &quot;boo.mid&quot;.</pre>
    <h6>:quit</h6>
    <p>Don't forget that you quit MIDA environment
      with <code>:quit</code> command!</p>
    <pre>mida> :quit
-> Goodbye.</pre>

    <h3 id="5.5">5.5 Ranges</h3>
    <p>Now that you know all the basics, we can talk about advanced
      methods of element manipulation. Simplest such method is
      range. Range in MIDA is written as two numbers (or note alias)
      separated by two commas <code>..</code> (without space between
      them). Range notation represents collection of successive
      natural numbers from left-side number to right-side number
      inclusively.</p>
    <pre>mida> 1..3
=> 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1...
mida> 5..2
=> 5 4 3 2 5 4 3 2 5 4 3 2 5 4 3 2...
mida> c5..e5
=> 60 61 62 63 64 60 61 62 63 64 60 61 62 63 64 60...</pre>
    <p>Although you cannot specify step between resulting elements,
      you can add a number to all elements of a principle or multiply
      all the elements by given number. How? Keep reading!</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.6">5.6 Addition</h3>
    <p>For transformation of a principle we use square brackets
      (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>). First, we put a principle
      into brackets, then we put an operator and its argument. It's
      also a good idea to put a comma after the argument for
      readability. For addition we use the plus
      operator <code>+</code>:</p>
    <pre>mida> [1..3] + 10, 50
=> 11 12 13 50 11 12 13 50 11 12 13 50 11 12 13 50...</pre>
    <p>This should be pretty staightforward.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.7">5.7 Multiplication</h3>
    <p>Multiplication is done in similar fashion. Use
      asterisk <code>*</code> to multiply a principle by a given
      number:</p>
    <pre>mida> [1..3] * 2
=> 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 2 4 6 2...</pre>
    <p>You can combine different operations easily:</p>
    <pre>mida> [[1..3] * 2] + 10
=> 12 14 16 12 14 16 12 14 16 12 14 16 12 14 16 12...</pre>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.8">5.8 Repitition</h3>
    <p>Operator for repetition is <code>$</code>, it's really
      useful:</p>
    <pre>mida> [1..3] $ 3, 10
=> 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 10 1 2 3 1 2 3...</pre>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.9">5.9 Rotation</h3>
    <p>You also can 'rotate' a principle with caret <code>^</code>
      operator, removing its former elements that will appear at the
      end of the principle:</p>
    <pre>mida> [1..3] ^ 1
=> 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2...
mida> [1..3] ^ 2
=> 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3...
mida> [1..3] ^ 3
=> 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1...</pre>
    <p>This is so-called left rotation, but you can emulate
      right-rotation too knowing length of given princple.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.10">5.10 Reverse</h3>
    <p>One can reverse order of elements in a principle by putting it
      into angle brackets (<code>&lt;</code>
      and <code>&gt;</code>):</p>
    <pre>mida> &lt;1 2 3&gt;
=> 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3...</pre>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.11">5.11 Multivalues</h3>
    <p>So far, we've worked only with literal values. But MIDA knows
      one more kind of element: <i>multivalue</i>. Multivalue is such
      an element that has many values at the same time. You know, just
      like electron exists in different positions around atomic
      nucleus. Realization of multivalue is a random value chosen from
      all possible variants.</p>
    <p>Multivale is written as collection of possible values inside of
      braces:</p>
    <pre>mida> {1 2 3}
=> 3 1 3 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 3 2 2 1 1 2...</pre>
    <p>As you can see, the same element is replicated, but its
      realized value is different for every instance. Here we have
      uniform probability, but you can change it with help of
      repetition:</p>
    <pre>mida> {1 1 2 3} // 1 - 50%, 2 - 25%, 3 - 25%
=> 1 1 1 3 1 3 1 3 2 1 3 1 3 1 1 1...
mida> {[1] $ 8, 2 3} // 1 - 80%, 2 - 10%, 3 - 10%
=> 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 1 1...</pre>
    <p>Basic operations work together! You can put a multivalue into
      anoter multivalue too:</p>
    <pre>mida> {1 {2 3}} // 1 - 50%, 2 - 25%, 3 - 25%
=> 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 3 1 1 2...</pre>
    <p><code>1</code> has probability 50%, and <code>{2 3}</code> has
      probability 50%. Inside <code>{2 3}</code> every element has
      equal probablity 50%, so result probabilities look
      like: <code>1</code> - 50%, <code>2</code> - 25%, <code>3</code>
      - 25%.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.12">5.12 Conditional Multivalues</h3>
    <p>One step forward is <i>conditional multivalues</i>. These are
      just like multivalues, but they depend on realized value of
      previous element. For every value of previous element it
      provides collection of possible results. If there is no such a
      collection, random collection will be selected from all existing
      collections. If first element of a sequence is conditional
      multivale, actual multivalue (collection) will be chosen
      randomly.</p>
    <p>This example demonstrates syntax of conditional multivalue and its
      logic:</p>
    <pre>mida> {(1) 2 3 (2) 3 (3) 1}
=> 3 1 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 3 1 3...</pre>
    <p>If the last element has value <code>1</code>, conditional
      multivalue will have value <code>2</code> or <code>3</code>. If
      the last element has value <code>2</code>, conditional
      multivalue will have value <code>3</code> for sure, and so
      on.</p>
    <p>You can also put conditional multivalues inside multivalues or
      other conditional multivalues. For example, <code>{(1) 2 3 (2) 3
      (3) 1}</code> will behave just like <code>{{2 3} {3}
      {1}}</code>.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="6">6 Final Notes</h3>
    <p>It's allowed to put comments in MIDA source files or in
      interactive environment. MIDA uses C-like comments. Line
      comments starts with <code>//</code>, block comment starts
      with <code>/*</code> and ends with <code>*/</code>.</p>
    <p>Interpreter supports multiline input. It automatically detects
      unbalanced parenthesis, braces, brackets. If you want to
      continue writing a principle on the next line, end current line
      with a comma <code>,</code>. Since comma is allowed only between
      elements of a principle MIDA will know that current principle is
      not completed.</p>
    <p>I sincerely hope that MIDA will be useful to you. Good
    luck! </p>
