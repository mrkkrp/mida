    <h2 id="1">1 What is MIDA?</h2>
    <p>MIDA is a minimalistic language for creating generative MIDI
      files. MIDA is not interactive in sense that you cannot control
      result of its activity in real time, it is indended for
      producers and should be used with DAW. MIDA can help you create
      variative elements in your music in very simple way. Since MIDI
      can control a lot of different instruments, power of MIDA is
      truly great.</p>

    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h2 id="2">2 Installation</h2>
    <p>It's absolutely possible to install MIDA on any platform for
      which <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell
      Platform</a> is supported. However, there are some precompiled
      options that may be more convenient and straightforward for some
      people. In particular, I propose installer for Windows users and
      self-extracting script for Linux users. To install MIDA on other
      platforms see section <a href="2.3">Compilation from
      Source</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="2.1">2.1 Windows</h3>
    <p>To install MIDA on
      windows <a href="https://github.com/mrkkrp/mida/releases">download
      MIDA installer</a>, then run it. To uninstall MIDA run
      uninstaller.</p>
    <h3 id="2.2">2.2 Linux</h3>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/mrkkrp/mida/releases">Download
      self-extracting script</a> and run it as root. To uninstall MIDA
      execute:</p>
    <pre># mida-rem</pre>
    <p>This script will remove MIDA from your system.</p>
    <h3 id="2.3">2.3 Compilation from Source</h3>
    <p>First,
      install <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell
      Platform</a>. You also need to
      install <a href="http://www.haskell.org/cabal/">Cabal</a>. After
      that, download <a href="https://github.com/mrkkrp/mida">MIDA
      source code</a>. Usually you need to update list of available
      packages:</p>
    <pre>$ cabal update
$ cabal install cabal-install</pre>
    <p>Now <code>cd</code> into directory containing downloaded
      repository of MIDA. Execute:</p>
    <pre>$ cabal configure
$ cabal build</pre>
    <p>It's very likely that Cabal will not compile MIDA from the
      first time so you'll need to install all dependencies that Cabal
      will list for you.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h2 id="3">3 Invocation</h2>
    <p>MIDA can work as translator from source code into MIDI files,
      and also as interactive environment (interpreter). Here's
      invocation scheme:</p>
    <pre>mida [-i|--interactive] [-s|--seed SEED] [-q|--quarter TICKS] [-b|--bars BARS] [-o|--output OUT] [FILE]</pre>
    <p>Let's list all available options:</p>
   <table>
      <tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      <tr><td><code>-h</code>,<code>--help</code></td>
        <td>Shows this information about invocation parameters and available options</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>-i</code>,<code>--interactive</code></td>
        <td>Enables interactive (interpreter) mode.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>-s</code>,<code>--seed</code></td>
        <td>Sets seed for MIDI generation, default value is 0</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>-q</code>,<code>--quarter</code></td>
        <td>Sets number of ticks for quarter note, default value is 24</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>-b</code>,<code>--bars</code></td>
        <td>Sets total time of result MIDI file as number of quarter notes (bars), default value is 16</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>-o</code>,<code>--output</code></td>
        <td>Specifies output filename. Default value is evaluated as <code>FILE</code> with extension <code>.mid</code></td></tr>
   </table>
    <p>If you don't supply any file as command line argument, MIDA
      will run in interactive mode even without <code>-i</code>
      option. Options <code>-s</code>, <code>-q</code>,
      and <code>-b</code> are ignored if option <code>-i</code> is
      used.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h2 id="4">4 Configuration File</h2>
    <p>One can customize MIDA to some extent using configuration
      file. One should create the file in his home directory. This
      directory will be different on different operating systems. On
      Linux machines it would be something
      like <code>/home/username/.mida</code>, while Windows users
      should create the file
      in <code>C:\Users\username\.mida</code>.</p>
    <p>For now, only two parameters can be changed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&bull; prompt (as <code>prompt</code>);</li>
        <li>&bull; length of displayed result of evaluation
        (as <code>length</code>).</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Syntax of <code>.mida</code> file is one of Unix configuration
      file. That is, you can use <code>#</code> to start comments,
      and <code>=</code> to assign new values (spaces before and
      after <code>=</code> are allowed).</p>
    <p>Here is complete example of <code>.mida</code> file:</p>
    <pre>#
# MIDA Configuration File
#

prompt = &quot;M> &quot;
length = 20
</pre>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h2 id="5">5 MIDA Tutorial</h2>
    <p>Now that you know all basic information about interpreter we
      can start our journey into magic world of MIDA.</p>
    <p>MIDA is minimalistic, but not very flexible or complex. In
      fact, it is so simple that any statement that has valid synax
      will produce valid result. A MIDA statement only has to pass
      parser, that's all. In fact, it's quite hard to enter invalid
      statement in MIDA and we'll see why.</p>
    <p>If you're interested in generative music, you probably know
      that there are lots of really advanced programs for algorithmic
      composition. But take a look at output of those programs. I
      don't mean to offend someone, but it's often not that
      impressive.</p>
    <p>What is the reason of that? Well, people who work with
      complicated tools tend to pay more attention to process than
      result. The more compilated tool you use the more time you spend
      on tool itself. Algorithm may be really impressive, but audience
      just don't give a fuck. We're gonna use basic tools of MIDA to
      create super sexy pop stuff, that's what we need, man, we need
      to be primitive and successful.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.1">5.1 Literal Values</h3>
    <p>Start interactive environment. Now you should be looking at
      something like this:</p>
    <pre>mida> _</pre>
    <p>You can try your powers right away. Remeber, MIDA is all about
      sequences of numbers. Numbers can repesent different things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&bull; durations;</li>
      <li>&bull; velocities;</li>
      <li>&bull; pitches.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's start from how you can enter the numbers at prompt and
      what you get as a result.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.1.1">5.1.1 Durations</h3>
    <p>Durations in MIDI are relative to <i>ticks per quarter note</i>
      (TPQ). TPQ is set before translation either via command line
      options or as parameters of command <code>:make</code>. As I
      said, default value is <code>24</code>, so try to work with this
      in mind.</p>
    <p>So, if quarter note is <code>24</code> ticks, whole note will
      be <code>96</code> ticks, while eight note will
      be <code>12</code> ticks, etc. You can also use any number in
      between creating really strange rhythms. Don't
      use <code>0</code>, because it's pretty useless and if your
      'score' consists of only zero durations you'll be unable to get
      realization longer than zero bars. Remember that you can use
      numbers greater than <code>127</code> for duration, so there is
      no limits.</p>
    <p>Let's enter a number:</p>
    <pre>mida> 24
=> 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24...
mida> _</pre>
    <p>So, we see that we can enter literals! However, the result may
    look a bit strange, but ignore this 'repetitiveness' for now.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.1.2">5.1.2 Velocities</h3>
    <p>Since MIDI format is piano-oriented, velocity in our case means
      loudness. Again, to write down velocities we use plain
      numbers. Valid values are form <code>0</code>
      to <code>127</code>, where <code>0</code> means silence,
      while <code>127</code> signifies loudest note.</p>
    <p>Although you can enter literals greater than <code>127</code>
      they are not guaranteed to be processed correctly.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.1.3">5.1.3 Pitches</h3>
    <p>Sure, you can use the same plain numbers from <code>0</code>
      to <code>127</code> for pitch, but it's a bit inconvinient. MIDA
      knows some alias for that case. Since MIDA doesn't work with
      negative numbers, we use alias where octaves start
      from <code>0</code>. So <code>c0</code> corresponds
      to <code>0</code> and so on: one semitone per number.</p>
    <p> This table may be useful:</p>
    <table>
      <tr><th rowspan="2">Octaves</th><th colspan="12">Notes</th></tr>
      <tr><td>c</td><td>c#</td><td>d</td><td>d#</td><td>e</td><td>f</td><td>f#</td><td>g</td><td>g#</td><td>a</td><td>a#</td><td>b</td></tr>
      <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>17</td><td>18</td><td>19</td><td>20</td><td>21</td><td>22</td><td>23</td></tr>

      <tr><td>5</td><td><b>60</b></td><td>61</td><td>62</td><td>63</td><td>64</td><td>65</td><td>66</td><td>67</td><td>68</td><td>69</td><td>70</td><td>71</td></tr>
      <tr><td>6</td><td>72</td><td>73</td><td>74</td><td>75</td><td>76</td><td>77</td><td>78</td><td>79</td><td>80</td><td>81</td><td>82</td><td>83</td></tr>
      <tr><td>7</td><td>84</td><td>85</td><td>86</td><td>87</td><td>88</td><td>89</td><td>90</td><td>91</td><td>92</td><td>93</td><td>94</td><td>95</td></tr>
      <tr><td>8</td><td>96</td><td>97</td><td>98</td><td>99</td><td>100</td><td>101</td><td>102</td><td>103</td><td>104</td><td>105</td><td>106</td><td>107</td></tr>
      <tr><td>9</td><td>108</td><td>109</td><td>110</td><td>111</td><td>112</td><td>113</td><td>114</td><td>115</td><td>116</td><td>117</td><td>118</td><td>119</td></tr>
      <tr><td>10</td><td>120</td><td>121</td><td>122</td><td>123</td><td>124</td><td>125</td><td>126</td><td>127</td><td colspan="4"></td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>Please note that there is no standard way to number octaves in
      MIDI. MIDI standard only says that note with
      index <code>60</code> must be <i>Middle C</i>. We've chosen
      zero-based system because of reasons that I've described
      earlier, some software starts numeration
      from <code>-2</code>.</p>
    <p>Enter any alais into MIDA and see for yourself that it's just
      like a corresponding MIDI code (note that all alais are
      case-sensitive):</p>
    <pre>mida> c5
=> 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60...</pre>
    <p>...and that's it! Now you can use literal values. Oh, that's
      incredible.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.2">5.2 Elements, Principles and Realizations</h3>
    <p>Smallest piece of composition in MIDA is
      called <i>element</i>. Now we know at least one kind of element:
      literal values. Realization of a literal value is just its
      value. Bear with me and all the stuff will be clear to you.</p>
    <p>Thing we enter into interactive prompt is
      called <i>principle</i>. A principle can consist of zero or more
      elements. These elements may be separated by
      commas <code>,</code>. Let's try some principles:</p>
    <pre>mida> 1, 2, 3
=> 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1...
mida> c5 d5 e5 f5 g5 a5 b5 c6
=> 60 62 64 65 67 69 71 72 60 62 64 65 67 69 71 72...</pre>
    <p>So, we enter a principle and MIDA prints its
      realization. Realization of a principle is bulit this way:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&bull; MIDA cycles elements (not their values, you'll see
      difference later), so we have now infinite collection of
      elements;</li>
      <li>&bull; it realizes all the elements one by one.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that MIDA realizes just as much as you need due to lazy
      evaluation.</p>
    <p>Realization can be either infinite sequence of non-negative
      numbers or <code>none</code>. <code>none</code> is a special
      value that represent realization of empty principle:</p>
    <pre>mida> 
=> none</pre>
    <p>In the next section we will see other roles
      of <code>none</code>.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to the top</a></p>
    <h3 id="5.3">5.3 Definitions</h3>
    <p>I said that it's quite hard to write incorrect statement in
      MIDA. Let's prove it. This is my attempt:</p>
    <pre>mida> foo
=> none
mida> asdfasdflk
=> none
mida> 1 2 rere 5
=> 1 2 5 1 2 5 1 2 5 1 2 5 1 2 5 1...</pre>
    <p>So, MIDA thinks that these things are realized
      to <code>none</code>, they can be even put inside a principle
      without any obvious harm.</p>
    <p>The thing is that MIDA considers any alpha-numeric sequence of
      characters that does not begin with a
      number <i>definition</i>. Definition can hold a principle and
      default value of any definition is <code>none</code>. You can
      combine definitions to build really complex principles.</p>
    <p>One can create definitions by putting alpha-numeric name on the
      left side of equation sign <code>=</code> and a principle on the
      right of the sigh. Let's give it a go:</p>
    <pre>mida> foo = 1 2 3
-> defined 'foo'
mida> foo
=> 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1...
mida> foo 5
=> 1 2 3 5 1 2 3 5 1 2 3 5 1 2 3 5...</pre>
    <p>It seems to work! What a magic! Remember that definitions are
      something like recipies how to create a principle, not static
      values. So we can change a definition and all other definitions
      which use it will change accordingly:</p>
    <pre>mida> foo = 5 boo = 6 baz = foo boo
-> defined 'foo'
-> defined 'boo'
-> defined 'baz'
mida> baz
=> 5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6 5 6...
mida> boo = 10
-> defined 'boo'
mida> baz
=> 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10...</pre>
    <p>And since all possible definitions have the default value, we
      can even design our principles in top-down manner, using
      definitions that we haven't defined yet!</p>
    <p>Now you're ready to create your first piece of music, but
      before you do it I should explain something about <i>top-level
      definitions</i>. There are special names that represent
      duration, velocity, and pitch of different voices. There may be
      up to 8 different voices in a MIDA score.</p>
    <p>The names are as following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&bull; <code>dur_</code> &ndash; durations;</li>
      <li>&bull; <code>vel_</code> &ndash; velocities;</li>
      <li>&bull; <code>pch_</code> &ndash; pitches.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Substitute <code>_</code> with index of desired voice, valid
      values are from <code>0</code> to <code>7</code>.</p>
    <p>Let's create some music:</p>
    <pre>mida> dur0 = 24
-> defined 'dur0'
mida> vel0 = 70
-> defined 'vel0'
mida> pch0 = c5 d5 e5 f5 g5 a5 b5
-> defined 'pch0'</pre>
    <p>It's as simple as that! Other top-level definitions hold empty
      principles, so they will be ignored. Use <code>:make</code>
      command to create a MIDI file:</p>
    <pre>mida> :make 0 24 14
-> MIDI file saved as &quot;interactive.mid&quot;.</pre>
    <p>Use any available software to hear this astonishing
      masterpiece. Full description of available commands is available
      in the next section.</p>

    <p>MIDA has a number of useful commands that can be fired from
      interactive environment. Let's examine all of them.</p>
