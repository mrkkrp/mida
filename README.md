# MIDA

## Description

MIDA is a minimalistic language for algorithmic generation of MIDI
files. MIDA is not interactive in sense that you cannot control result of
its activity in real time, it is intended for producers and should be used
with a DAW. MIDA can help you create variative elements in your music in a
very simple way. Since MIDI can control a lot of different instruments,
power of MIDA is truly great.

Main reason for MIDA development is to create software tool that can be used
in such a way that does not change established workflow, so people could use
familiar plugins and software instruments.

See [MIDA Manual](http://mrkkrp.github.io/mida/) for more information.

For installation instructions see `INSTALL.md`.

MIDA is a [member of Linux Audio
consortium](http://linuxaudio.org/members.html).

## TODO

Currently we're trying to achieve the following goals in order to improve
MIDA:

* full refactoring to make the code more elegant;
* add Jack support for interactive preview;
* rewrite documentation in TexInfo format.
