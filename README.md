# MIDA

## Description

MIDA is a minimalistic language for creating generative MIDI
files. MIDA is not interactive in sense that you cannot control result
of its activity in real time, it is intended for producers and should
be used with a DAW. MIDA can help you create variative elements in
your music in very simple way. Since MIDI can control a lot of
different instruments, power of MIDA is truly great.
